If so good for u I tell u how to build cuz no brain cells.

first download dis: http://www.modcoderpack.com/files/mcp918.zip
extract it with winrar or something https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0

when u done then u double click decompile.bat let it run until its finished
then u should see all the files show up open src then go into minecraft
delete all in there or replace it with the src in the github then open eclipse
choose the eclipse folder.
